# Guide to working with AI in Base44

Prompting in Base44 is like briefing a creative partner who builds exactly what you describe. You tell Base44 what kind of app you want, who it’s for, and what it should do, and it generates a live, working version you can edit, expand, and launch.

Whether you're building a simple tool or a multi-feature app, a clear prompt helps you get faster, better results.

## **Core principles for great prompts**

These four principles will help you write prompts that produce stronger, more useful results.

### **1. Be clear and specific**

Base44 is very good about understanding what you need, but the more details you can provide about what the app should do, who it’s for, and what features matter most, the better. If it’s important to you, make sure to include it.

Here’s a good example: “I want an app that helps personal trainers manage client workout plans and track weekly progress.”

### **2. Focus on the user’s journey**

Consider how a user will interact with your app. If you have a clear vision about the sequence of actions a user will take, it will help Base44 build the right structure.

Here’s an example: “Users sign up, create a new project, set milestones, and track their progress daily.”

### **3. Describe the “what,” not the “how”**

We handle all of the complexity behind the scenes so there’s no need to describe how the back end should function. Just describe what the app should do or look like.

Try this as an example: “The app should store user data, load quickly, and feel clean and modern.”

### **4. Iterate and refine**

Remember, while Base44 will give you a fully-functional output, your first prompt is still a starting point. You can always work with it on big changes, small refinements, or entirely new directions.

## **Prompt frameworks**

Not sure how to articulate what you want to say? Use these frameworks below for inspiration.

### **1. The “Who / What / Why” Prompt**

Perfect for when you’re starting from scratch.

- **WHO** is this app for?
- **WHAT** does it help them do?
- **WHY** would someone use it?

<u>Example</u>:\
WHO: This app is for independent consultants.\
WHAT: It helps them manage client projects, contracts, and deadlines in one dashboard.\
WHY: To save time, stay organized, and never miss deliverables.

### **2. The “User Story” Prompt**

A variation on the “who/what/why” prompt through a different lens.

<u>Examples</u>:

- “As a freelance designer, I want to send branded invoices to clients and track when they’re paid, so I can stay on top of my cash flow.”
- “As a new parent, I want to log my baby’s feedings and naps, so I can spot patterns and share them with my pediatrician.”

### **3. The “Feature Breakdown” Prompt**

When you’re mid-build and come up with a great addition to your app.

<u>Example</u>:\
    I want to add the following capabilities:

- Add and organize leads
- Track outreach status (new, contacted, interested, closed)
- Add notes and follow-up reminders

## **Techniques to get better results**

When you’re refining your app, there are some ways you can talk to Base44 that will help it execute on your vision. Here they are, along with some pro tips to take them to the next level.

| **Technique**                         | **When to Use It**                                     | **Examples**                                                                                                  | **Pro Tip**                                                                                                                                       |

| **“Add a…” / “Remove the…”**          | Add/remove specific features or UI blocks              | - “Add a comments section to each task.”<br />- “Remove the pricing page for now.”                            | <u>Group actions for greater efficiency</u>: “Add a comments section and move it below the task list.”                                            |
| **“Change [this] to [that]”**         | Adjust text, visuals, layout, or component logic       | - “Change the sidebar color to charcoal.”<br />- “Change the ‘Submit’ button to say ‘Send Request’.”          | <u>Layer context</u>: “Change the button text to match the friendly tone used in the rest of the app.”                                            |
| **“It should feel like…”**            | Borrow familiar app styles to guide layout or behavior | - “It should feel like a mix between Duolingo and Habitica.”<br />- “Like a lighter version of Airtable.”     | <u>Clarify </u>_<u>which parts</u>_: “Use Duolingo’s playful tone and Habitica’s gamified progress system.”                                       |
| **“Add logic for…”**_(optional)_      | Add functional rules or flows without needing code     | - “Add logic to hide completed items from the default view.”<br />- “Send a reminder if no action in 3 days.” | <u>Describe the desired outcome once the logic is added</u>: “Add logic so users get nudged if they haven’t logged in for a week.”                |
| **“Group or organize...”**            | Structure content for clarity or workflow              | - “Group tasks by category”<br />- “Organize settings into collapsible sections”                              | <u>Mention user needs</u>: “Organize tasks by category so users can quickly find what they need.”                                                 |
| **“Add conditional behavior…”**       | Introduce smart branching or state-based functionality | - “Only show the download button after payment is confirmed.”                                                 | <u>Start simple, expand later</u>: “Add the condition first, then I’ll add variations per user type.”                                             |
| **“Let users…” statements**           | Frame functionality from the end-user’s perspective    | - “Let users upload documents and tag them.”<br />- “Let users bookmark resources for later.”                 | <u>Frame the functionality around unlocking value for the user</u>: “Let users upload documents and tag them so they can easily find them later.” |

## **Build in layers when building complexity**

If your app is getting more complex, break your requests into layers:

1. **Start simple**: “I want an app for tracking daily habits with streaks and reminders.”
2. **Stack on features**: “Now add the ability to group habits by theme (e.g., health, productivity).”
3. **Polish the visuals**: “Make the habit cards more colorful and use emoji icons for each.”

Prompting this way lets you build incrementally, without overwhelming the system or yourself.

## **Quick recap**

- **Don't overthink your first prompt.** You can always adjust.
- **Give context, not just features.** Why does this app matter?
- **Reference tools you like.** If you love how another app feels, say so.
- **Talk like you’d explain to a colleague.** Plain language \> technical terms.

## **Troubleshooting tips**

_Below is a list of frequently asked questions & helpful tips._

**My app was working, but something went wrong.**

If you can’t solve it after a few iterations, it might be time to reframe what you want to do. Click on the revert button to go back to the last working state and try a different angle.

**I can’t implement the feature I want.**

Some features might not be supported. If you’re unsure, visit our Support page or ask in our [<u>Discord</u>](https://discord.gg/ThpYPZpVts) help channel.

\*\*When I make a request, the AI is executing on it, but it’s touching parts of the app I don’t need it to touch. \*\*

Use AI Controls to limit the AI’s changes to only the areas you want updated. This is especially helpful if other parts of the app are getting altered intentionally.

**I can’t get the AI to make the exact styling change I want it to.**

Use Visual Edits to target specific parts of the UI and describe changes directly (eg. “In this selected area, change the text input to a dropdown showing these listed options: )

\*\*I’m using too many credits on iteration and I just want to think through some steps with the AI before doing anything else. \*\*

Use Discuss Mode, which is located on the bottom right hand corner of the Builder Chat, to have a conversation with the AI to review logic, build complex logic from scratch and ensure the AI understands your goals, and validate behaviors or explore alternatives before applying changes.

## **You’ve got this**

You already have the ideas. Now you’ve got the words to bring them to life. You don’t need to be technical to build something powerful. Start simple, speak naturally, and don’t be afraid to iterate.
