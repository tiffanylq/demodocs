### Getting started

<Expandable title="What is Base44?">
  Base44 is an AI-powered platform that lets you turn any idea into a fully-functional custom app, without the need for any coding experience.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Do I need coding experience to use Base44?">
  No. Our platform is designed to be easily accessible to non-technical users. Just describe your software needs in plain language, and our AI will handle the technical implementation.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What kinds of applications can I build with Base44?">
  Base44 is versatile and can be used to build a wide range of applications, including but not limited to: personal productivity apps, back-office tools, customer portals, and business process automation tools. You can also use it for rapid prototyping and creating MVPs.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How long does it take to launch something?">
  Most users can go from idea to live app in minutes.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How do I create my first app?">
  Just type in your idea and the platform will generate a working version. You can preview, tweak, and iterate right away.
</Expandable>

### Creating & editing

<Expandable title='What are "credits"?'>
  Credits represent the total number of actions you can take. Each message you send our AI asking it to take an action is one credit. Integration credits are used when a user of the app takes an action that requires the app to leverage integrations. For example, if an action in your app results in an LLM call, that is one integration credit.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I edit my app after it's built?">
  Yes\! You can continue prompting through the Builder Chat to change functionality, add features, shift layouts, adjust tone, and also republish as many times as you want.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="How do I write a good prompt?">
  Base44 is very good about understanding what you need, but the more details you can provide about what the app should do, who it‚Äôs for, and what features matter most, the better. If it‚Äôs important to you, make sure to include it. We have a <u>prompting guide</u> to help.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="What should I do if my app doesn't turn out how I imagined?">
  Try rephrasing your prompt or adding details. The platform is built for iteration, and the more you experiment, the better the results will be.
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Can I create a copy of my app?">
  Yes, go to Settings ‚Üí App Settings ‚Üí Clone App ‚Üí Create Copy. A duplicate version will instantly open on your screen. You will be able to access your cloned app on your Apps page, marked with the suffix (Copy).
</Expandable>

### Publishing & sharing

Follow the instructions to connect your domain through the DNS provider.¬† Once the domain is connected, it can take up to an hour until your app is accessible through your domain.
