## **Micro-prompts to add polish**

Take your app from functional to delightful with small refinements that influence look, feel, and interactivity. These are great additions during the editing or iteration phase.

- ‚ÄúAdd hover effects so buttons gently lift on hover.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúUse a clean, modern design style like Notion.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúInclude soft drop shadows around cards for a subtle 3D feel.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúApply a rounded sans-serif font and a calm, muted color palette.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAdd smooth transitions between tabs or sections.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúShow a confetti animation when a user completes a task.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúMake this feel like a friendly mobile app with large touch targets, bright colors, playful icons.‚Äù

These prompts work well as refinements once your app is up and running, or even baked into your initial build prompt for more styled results from the start.
