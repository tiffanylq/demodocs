# Let's build.

This guide walks you through the essentials of Base44’s platform, including how to navigate the workspace, how to build your first app quickly and confidently, and how to keep an eye on your credits.

## This is Base44

Base44’s interface is split into two main sections:

- **Left side: The builder chat**\
  This is where you talk to Base44. You can give it new ideas, ask for changes, get suggestions, and more. 
- **Right side: The app preview**\
  This is the working version of your app. It’s live, interactive, and customizable.\
  Click any element to test it or make tweaks using the visual editor tool.

## **The builder chat**

The primary action of the builder chat is to use natural language prompts to build and refine your app. However, there are elements at the bottom of the screen to explore a bit further.

<u>Note</u>: For every prompt you enter, you can go back into the chat and click \*\*“Revert This” \*\*anytime to undo your prompt. You’ll be asked to confirm your request, and then the app will then revert to the state it was in just prior to that point.

## **Preview & Workspace**

To the right of the Builder Chat is the \*\*Preview \*\*window, where you can interact with your app in real time and get a feel for how it will look and behave once it’s live.

When you toggle to **Workspace**, a menu will open and you’ll be able to: 

- Manage user access and invite collaborators
- Access your analytics
- Set your app to public or private
- Add a custom domain
- Adjust security settings
- And even get into the code if you want to

### **Additional Tools & Icons**

You'll also notice a few icons that open up more functionality.

- **Activity monitor** – View recent activity and see how many requests your app has made.
- **See all files **– Peek under the hood to view your app’s files and components. You can also export your project as a zip file or push it to GitHub.
- **Share/Collaborate **– Invite others to collaborate on your app. Share access via email or link.
- **Mobile view **– Preview how your app looks on mobile devices. Use it to check that your design is responsive and user-friendly.
- **Refresh** – Manually refresh your preview to see the latest changes after edits.

## **Building your first app: step-by-step**

1. **Start with a clear prompt:**\
   Use simple language to describe what you want your app to do. For example:\
   \_“Create a task manager app where users can add, categorize, and complete tasks with progress tracking.” \_You can also select a starter prompt from the <u>Prompt library</u> or check out our <u>Guide on how to work with AI </u>for help creating your own. 
2. **Let Base44 do its thing:**\
   Base44 will generate your app’s interface and backend automatically. The Preview immediately updates as you go.
3. **Customize as needed:**\
   Continue refining via the Builder Chat or use the Visual Editor function to manually adjust colors, fonts, text, and more with intuitive controls.
4. **Test your app:**\
   Interact with the Preview as an end user would. Make sure everything works as expected.
5. **Launch with confidence:**\
   When you’re ready to show your friends or colleagues, you can click the **Share** icon at the top right of the screen. This will generate a link that can allow users to access your app. You can also hit **Publish** to create a link accessible to the public. Base44 handles the hosting so there’s nothing else you need to do to deploy.

## **Understanding credits**

Base44 operates on a **credit** **system** tied to app complexity and usage.

### Message credits

Credits represent the total number of actions you can take. Each message you send our AI asking it to take an action is one credit. You can easily upgrade your plan as needed.

You can monitor your credit usage in two ways:

- From the dropdown menu under “**Credits**”
- From the upper right icon, you can click on your avatar, then click on **Billing**.

### Integration credits

Integration credits are used when a user of the app takes an action that requires the app to leverage integrations. For example, if an action in your app results in an LLM call, that is 1 integration credit.
