## **Introduction**

### **What is "Data" in Base44?**

In Base44, **Data** refers to the structured information stored within your app, powering dynamic functionality such as users, content, orders, activities, and more.

You manage this data through **tables** (similar to databases), where each table has **fields** (columns) representing different types of information.

### **Common Use Cases**

- Managing **users** (profiles, roles)
- Storing **content** (products, blog posts)
- Handling **orders** (e-commerce, reservations)
- Collecting **activities** (event tracking, logs)

### **Field Types**

- **Text** (Short Text, Long Text)
- **Number**
- **Boolean** (Yes/No)
- **Date/Time**
- **File** (Images, Documents)
- **Reference** (Link to another record/table)
- **Object** (Nested structured data like JSON)

### **Table Permissions**

Each table has its own security settings, controlling who can **read** and **write** its data.

üîí **Read Access**: Who can view records\
‚úçÔ∏è **Write Access**: Who can create, update, or delete records

_Note: For a full explanation, see the _[_Security Dashboard guide_](https://docs.base44.com/GuidelineDetail?id=680b5baaaea9bfa3a4f275b6)_._

## **Working with Data**

### **Manually Adding Records**

- Go to **Workspace ‚Üí Data**.
- Select the relevant table.
- Click **‚Äú\+ Add‚Äù** and fill out the fields manually.

> **_Tip_**_: You can ask the chat to create a form inside your app to add new items dynamically._

### **Uploading Data (CSV Import)**

- First, export a **sample CSV** from your table to understand the correct format.
- Prepare your data to match the sample structure.
- Use **Import CSV** to upload your data.

> **_Tip_**_: Always export a sample CSV first to prevent formatting errors._

### **Deleting and Batch Operations**

- To delete a single record, click the **üóëÔ∏è delete button** next to it.
- To delete all records in a table, use **‚ÄúDelete All‚Äù** under the **Actions** menu.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è _Warning: Bulk deletion is irreversible._

### **Connecting Your Data to Another App**

- Go to **Workspace ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API**.
- Select the entity (table) you want to share.
- Generate code examples for **reading** and **writing**.
- Pass the generated code into the chat of another app to instruct it how to interact with your data.

### **Data Creation Safety**

- To protect your data:
  - The AI Assistant can **only create** (add new records).
  - It **cannot delete** or remove existing records.
- **Example**: You can ask the chat to add mock data for testing, but even if you revert a message or request "deletion," your existing records will remain safe.

### **Common Problems and Solutions**

- **Problem:** Can't create, view, or edit my data
- **Cause:** Permissions are restricted
- **How to Fix:** Check your table's security settings under Workspace ‚Üí App Security
