# **App security: Row-level security (RLS) guide**

## **Overview**

Control who can access, read, write, or delete records in your app’s data entities using **Row-Level Security (RLS)** rules. Configure access for each entity to ensure data is only available to authorized users.

---

## **When to use these features**

### **Secure data handling**

Use this when:

- Sensitive or private data should **not be visible** to all users.
- You want to avoid exposing **unintended records** through APIs, exports, or reports.
- The app includes **user-generated content**, and each user should only access their own data.

**Example use cases**:

- A fitness app where each user should only see his training sessions.
- A company dashboard where employees can only see their own performance metrics.

### **User-specific data views**

Use this when:

- You want to **personalize the app experience** based on user role, department, or ownership.
- Different users or roles should see **different subsets** of data.
- You're building multi-tenant applications where users **should not see other tenants' data**.

**Example use cases**:

- A CRM where sales reps only see leads assigned to them.
- A school app where teachers can only view students in their classes.
- An admin panel where different roles (admin, editor, viewer) have different data access levels.

## **Accessing security settings**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to app security">
    Open your app workspace and go to the "**Security**" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your dashboard">
    In the security dashboard, you can see a list of your application data entities. Each entity shows its current security status: **Public** or **Restricted**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit security rules">
    Click on an entity to view or update its security rules.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Security modes**

- **Public Access (No Restrictions)** – All users can access all records in the entity.
- **Resticted Acccess** – Only users matching defined rules can access records.

---

## **Assigning & managing rules**

### Rule types

When editing an entity’s security, you can define rules for:

- **Read Access**
- **Write/Delete Access**

Each rule can be **one** of the following:

- **No Restrictions** – All users can access records.
- **Creator Only** – Users can only access records they created.
- **Entity-User Field Comparison **– Compare a field in the entity (e.g., 'Organization') with a user property (e.g., user's 'Organization').
  - _Example_: Only users whose department matches the record’s department can access it.
- **User Property Check **– Restrict access based on a user property like 'role' or 'email'.
  - _Example_: Only users with the role "admin" can access records.

### How to add or edit rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose access type">
    Switch between **Read Access** and **Write/Delete Access** tabs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add rule">
    Click **“Add Rule”**, select a rule type, and complete the required fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multiple rules (optional)">
    Add multiple rules if needed. Access is granted if any rule matches (or logic).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom write/delete rules">
    By default, these inherit from Read Access. Click "**Create Custom Write Rules**" to define separate rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove rules">
    You can click **Remove All Rules** to remove your entity security rules. Use **“Remove All Rules”** to make the entity public again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Generated rules (JSON)

All rules are shown as read-only JSON for transparency.

### Example scenarios

- **Public Entity**: No rules set. All users have access.
- **Creator Only**: Add a rule so users can only see their own records.
- **Department-Based Access**: Match the record's department field to the user's department.
- Admin-Only Access: Use a role check. Only users with "**role = admin"** have access.

### **Visual Summary**

- Each entity card displays a summary of its current rules.
- Icons and short descriptions indicate **Read** and **Write/Delete** settings.

## **Tips**

- You must **create entities** before configuring security.
- Changes are **saved per entity**.
- Always click **“Save Security Rules”** after editing.
